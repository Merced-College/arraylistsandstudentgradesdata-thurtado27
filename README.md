# arrayListsAndStudentGradesData

This is your README.md file where you can write your reflection response for this programming project.

The easiest part of the lab was making the Course class and the getter methods because it was mostly just storing information and returning it. Once we understood that each index in the ArrayList represented a letter grade, the calculations were pretty simple to write. The biggest problem we ran into was reading the CSV file, at first the program would crash because it tried to read the header lines as numbers, and some values had spaces. We fixed it by skipping the first two lines and using .trim() before converting to integers. From this lab I learned that storing an ArrayList inside an object keeps everything organized since each course holds its own grade data and the methods can calculate directly from it instead of using a bunch of separate arrays. After doing this, I feel pretty confident reading CSV files now because I understand how to split lines, clean the data, and store it into objects, though I’d still double-check formatting if the file was messy.
